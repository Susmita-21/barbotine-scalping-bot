[For profitability reasons, the source code is now available for financial supporters only.]

Working on the BTC/USDT pair on 10-second timeframe, Barbotine Scalping is a crypto scalping bot betting on the market manipulation happening on Bitfinex thanks to their detailed orderbook API. Included with the bot is a indicator I created for this purpose, the 'DWM', which means the bid/ask delta weighted-median BTC amount per user per order ratio.

The unavoidable question: is it profitable? To answer quickly, yes you can make money with it. But this is speculation, so I'm not responsible of any kind of money you win or loose with my software, I'm a developer, not a fund manager.
